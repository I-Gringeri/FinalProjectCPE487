# Attempt 1
### This is the original base code we attempted to start with   
### We decided to abandon this code for a few reasons: 
1. None of the modules actually worked
2. Each functionality was very complicated, involving multiple modules to accmplish each function   
For example, tone_generator, song_controller, microphone, and audio_mixer were all integrated to produce the final audio output   
This made each feature extremely hard to debug
3. It became apparent that the scope of the code was too large, and an iterative approach to debugging by getting a working implementation of each desired feature (audio, lyrics, etc) was better

This is the original button map for this implementation:
