# Second Attempt
### After quickly abandoning our original base code, we attempted to build a working PWM audio generator in its own module

Once we achieved a successful (although quite terrible sounding) play through of the melody, we then created another test folder to build the VGA lyrics output    
After working on the VGA for a while, we integrated the test.vhd file from this iteration into the top module from the VGA part, and this became the base for our final iteration
